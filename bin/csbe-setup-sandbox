    Setup sandbox configuration for any number of scenarios. Following the execution
    of this script, you will need to quit your shells and fire up new ones.

    The order options are specified on the command line matters. The most significant,
    list in the usage statuements above, needs to be first.

    --unified-cfg-file
        Remove any sandbox options which will setup for use with the config files deployed
        via 'dt-dev-update-secrets'. The config will be loaded from a file. It will not be
        stored in mongo.

        This will set the CSSVC_CFG_FILE variable according to the unified config process:
        https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream-server/blob/develop/api_server/docs/unified-cfg-file.md

    --store-cfg-in-mongo  [--init-with-unified <cfgName>]
        Store config in mongo initialized with open-development.json (most basic config). This will
        set the CSSVC_CFG_URL env variable to your local mongo codestream database. When starting
        the api with an empty database, it will initially load a config based on the additional
        args.

        The default (no additional args) is to initialize it from api_server/etc/configs/open-development.json.
        --init-with-unified will find the named config file (eg. onprem-development, codestream-cloud,
        onprem-development-custom, ...) that matches the repos' schema version and use that.
